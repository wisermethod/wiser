Usage:
  node scripts/parse.js help
  node scripts/parse.js parse --file <path> [--format csv|json|tsv] [--delimiter <char>] [--no-header]

Commands:
  parse            Read the file and report its columns, types, and row count
  help             Print this message

Options:
  --file <path>    Data file to parse (absolute path), outside this tool
                   directory. Required.
  --format <fmt>   Force csv, json, or tsv. Omit to auto-detect from the content.
  --delimiter <c>  Field delimiter for delimited text. Omit to auto-detect.
  --no-header      Treat the first row as data; columns are named column_1, column_2, ...
  --install   Authorise the first-run install. Without it a tool that is
              not installed yet reports what it would fetch, and from
              where, and stops. WISER_ALLOW_INSTALL=1 does the same
              for an unattended run.
  --help, -h       Print this message

 * `resolve` normalizes lexically and follows nothing on disk, so a symbolic
 * link, a link in any parent component, and a relative spelling are three
 * strings a lexical comparison does not match. `realpathSync` resolves every
 * component against the filesystem, which turns the comparison below from a
 * string check into an identity check. A path whose leaf is absent is
 * canonicalized through the deepest ancestor that does exist and the missing
 * components joined back on, so a symbolic link standing in for any ancestor
 * cannot hide where the path lands.
 *
 * Absence is the only reason to keep walking. Any other refusal from the
 * filesystem, an unreadable ancestor or a loop of symbolic links, means the
 * real path cannot be known, and a screen that cannot know what it is looking
 * at refuses rather than falling back to the caller's spelling.

# Connecting LinkedIn

See [gateway/SETUP.md](../../gateway/SETUP.md) for attachment and the gateway's provider setup. Connect Account is a separate human turn.

## On the platform's side, first

Use a LinkedIn account that can access the requested resources. If the organization restricts third-party apps, obtain its approval for the gateway's provider application. Prepare the OAuth blueprint through the gateway's provider as described by [gateway/SETUP.md](../../gateway/SETUP.md).

## Through the gateway

1. Request "Connect LinkedIn" for `linkedin` / `profile`.
2. The skill runs `start_connect` for that service and module. Open its hosted link in your own browser.
3. Sign in to LinkedIn and approve the requested access in your browser.
4. The skill runs `connect_status`. Only ACTIVE unlocks the module.

This connector uses hosted connect only. No key belongs in this file or the conversation.

## Grant

`profile` has read privilege. Only this module is included in this slice.

## Revoking

**Revoke through the gateway.** `disconnect`, with this service and any of its modules, revokes the credential at the provider and removes every local record of it.

- **It ends every module bound to that credential and not only the one you name.** It stops first and lists them in `modules_ending`. **That list is what is bound at the moment it asks, not a promise**: what you approve is the credential, so anything attached to it before you answer ends too. The answer reports what was actually removed.
- **If someone wants one of those modules kept, their request cannot be met as asked, and saying so is the answer.** The credential is the unit; there is no way to end part of one. Two routes work. Either agree that both end, or first connect the module they want kept on a credential of its own — `start_connect` for that service and module, then `connect_status` — and only then run `disconnect`, **naming a module still on the old credential**, checking that `modules_ending` no longer lists the one you moved. **Do not approve the teardown hoping it spares one**, and do not take the vendor route instead, which is broader rather than narrower.
- **The vendor route below does not reach the same set, and may reach further.** `disconnect` acts on one provider account, and that account is what defines its scope; `modules_ending` reports the local bindings known to it when it asks. Rolling or deleting a credential at the vendor acts on everything that credential authorises, which can include modules bound to a different provider account, other machines, and other people. **`modules_ending` does not describe the vendor route**; before taking it, work out what else uses that credential.
- **It acts on one credential.** A service connected more than once needs one `disconnect` per credential. **`list_connections` shows what this machine has recorded and nothing more**: it cannot establish that no credential for this service remains at the provider, because discovery lists only ACTIVE accounts, skips a toolkit holding more than one, and fetches a single page. To be sure a service is gone, check at the vendor. Do not read one teardown, or an empty listing, as removing a service entirely.
- **Revoking is not scoped to this workspace.** The credential lives at the provider, and the store is per person rather than per workspace, so ending it can end access from another machine or another workspace using the same grant. Settle that before approving.
- **It removes nothing locally unless the provider confirms the credential is gone**, so a grant that is merely suspended keeps its records.
- **A finished teardown says what it established, in `credential_revoked`.** `yes` means every step the provider reported succeeded. **`unknown` means the provider's record of the credential is gone and an earlier step failed**, so the credential may still work at the vendor even though nothing here points at it any more. Removing the local rows is right either way; **`unknown` is not a completed cutoff**, and the vendor route below is what finishes it.

**At the vendor instead**, if you would rather, or if `disconnect` answers `needs_provider_capability`, meaning this provider will not revoke this credential for you. Remove the application's access at LinkedIn settings permitted services. Afterwards run `connect_status` for each module you revoked and read what it returns: it asks the provider and records the answer, so the row stops reading ACTIVE only once the provider agrees, and a provider error leaves it unchanged. A `how` field on the gateway's answer is the adapter's own words; where it names a route this guide does not list, the two disagree and that is worth reporting rather than following.

## Rate limits

Live limits are UNVERIFIED. If a gateway status reports a rate limit, stop and follow the platform's current retry guidance before another call.

## Last connected

Yes.
